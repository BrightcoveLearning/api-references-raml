To learn how to restrict playback for all the players in an account, see the <a href=\"https://support.brightcove.com/node/8065\">Restricting Video Playback Using IP Address</a> document.<br><br></li><li>The raw API JSON response is not suitable with the player. Use the <code>player.catalog.transformVideoResponse()</code> function to convert each video object in the response into a format compatible with the player. This includes duration times and https image compatibility. For details, see the <a href=\"https://support.brightcove.com/node/18108\">Player Catalog</a> document.</li></ul>",
